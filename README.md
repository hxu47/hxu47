# Hi there! üëã

My name is Huidong Xu, and I'm a passionate Data Scientist with 3+ years of experience in implementing various machine learning algorithms and building data-driven applications. I love working on challenging projects, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new techniques to enhance my skills and contribute to the world of data science.

## üíº Work Experience

I am an AI data scientist at Lemonade, I focused on risk prediction and automation of underwriting processes. I collaborated with actuaries and underwriters, designing, building, deploying, and monitoring machine learning models end-to-end. My key achievements include:

- Built a vehicle accident risk prediction model using a GLM on telematic (GPS/accelerometer) data, improving insurance pricing accuracy.
- Developed a ride-sharing trip prediction solution using XGBoost, reducing policy violations.
- Improved a legacy model identifying high-risk customers during the quote and enrollment phases, resulting in a 5% decrease in potential losses.
- Developed data pipelines to improve local time calculation for trips, reducing processing time by 90%.
- Implemented computer vision models using ResNet in PyTorch to identify unqualified vehicle photos, improving the efficiency of the underwriting department.
- Created a web application for searching and labeling vehicle photos using Streamlit, reducing manual working time by 20 hours per month.


## üìö Academic Projects

- **Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch**: I have implemented various machine learning algorithms comparable to Scikit-learn's, including Regularized Linear and Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-means Clustering, Boosting, and Automated Feature Selection Algorithms.
- **BBC Article Recommendations**: I built a web server using Flask and EC2 to display BBC article recommendations using word2vec.
