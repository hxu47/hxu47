# Hi there! üëã

I'm **Sophie(Huidong)**. With over 3+ years of experience, I specialize in implementing machine learning algorithms and crafting scalable data-driven applications. My strengths lie in handling vast datasets and creating optimized ETL processes. I'm passionate about the ever-evolving world of data and always eager to learn, adapt, and contribute.

## üõ† Work Experience:

- **Telematics Data Mastery** üåç
  - Managed end-to-end lifecycle of large-scale telematics (GPS/accelerometer) data.
  - Developed ETL processes to manage billions of rows, extracting essential features for risk prediction.

- **Performance Optimization** ‚ö°
  - Designed a real-time infrastructure for GLM-based risk prediction, integrating it with auto insurance pricing to exceed industry benchmarks by 200%.
  - Achieved 90% processing time reduction via geospatial data optimization.

- **Automation & Monitoring** ü§ñ
  - Introduced automation with Databricks and Apache Airflow.
  - Set up monitoring protocols for consistent data quality and model performance.

- **Cloud Mastery** ‚òÅÔ∏è
  - Designed and hosted a web app on AWS EC2 using Streamlit, marking a significant decrease in manual effort.

## üì¶ GitHub Repositories:

- **[Semantic Search Engine](https://github.com/hxu47/sbert-search-bar)**: Launched a resilient search engine, fortified with a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for timely updates.
- **[Netflix Data Analysis ETL](https://github.com/hxu47/ETL-Pipeline-for-Netflix-Data-Analysis)**: Crafted an ETL pipeline with DBT, Snowflake, and Airflow. Visualization made possible with Quicksight.
- **[Article Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/hxu47/Article-Recommendation-Engine)**: A web application that recommends BBC articles based on user preferences using word2vec.
- **[Spark Streaming](https://github.com/hxu47/Databricks-Real-Time-Streaming-with-Event-Hubs-and-Snowflake)**: Real-time data ingestion and processing using Azure Event Hub, Databricks, and Snowflake.
- **[Feature Importance Exploration](https://github.com/hxu47/Feature-Importance)**: Detailed exploration of diverse feature-importance methods for ML models.
- **Machine Learning Implementations**: Demonstrated in-depth understanding with ground-up creations of ML algorithms like **[Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes](https://github.com/hxu47/Sentiment-Analysis-with-Naive-Bayes-from-Scratch)**, **[KMeans](https://github.com/hxu47/KMeans-from-Scratch)**, **[Decision Tree](https://github.com/hxu47/Decision-Tree-from-Scratch)**, **[Random Forest](https://github.com/hxu47/Random-Forest-from-Scratch)**, **[Linear Regression](https://github.com/hxu47/Linear-Regression-from-Scratch)**
